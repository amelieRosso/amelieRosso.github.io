<p> I am a Junior at Cornell University studying Information Science in the College of Engineering with a minor in Artificial Intelligence.

<h2> World Heritage Search 
(<a href="https://github.com/amelieRosso/4300-JSON-travel_match">GitHub</a>)
</h2> 
<p> A natural language search platform focused on UNESCO World Heritage Sites that utilizes an SVD-based cosine similarity algorithm. 
  This was a team project where I contributed to designing the information retrieval algorithms and implemented the cosine similarity algorithm.
  I also integrated a 3D map interface using ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript, adding a spatial component to the search results. </p>
